## 🚀 Deployment Status Update

### ✅ Security Vulnerabilities - RESOLVED
All dependency vulnerabilities have been successfully resolved:
- Updated Vite 5.4.19 → 7.1.4 
- Updated Vitest and related packages to 3.2.4
- Fixed esbuild security vulnerability (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99)
- **Current status: 0 vulnerabilities** 🎉

### ⚠️ Vercel CLI Authentication Required
The Vercel CLI deployment is failing due to missing credentials:

**Issue**: `No existing credentials found. Please run vercel login`

**Resolution Steps**:
1. **Login to Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```
   This will open your browser to authenticate with GitHub/email.

2. **Verify authentication**:
   ```bash
   vercel whoami
   ```

3. **Deploy manually** (if needed):
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### 🔍 TruffleHog Security Scan
The TruffleHog scan failed because BASE and HEAD commits are the same.
This is expected when there are no new commits to scan between runs.

### ✅ Application Status
- Build: ✅ Successful
- Tests: ✅ Passing  
- Dependencies: ✅ No vulnerabilities
- Development server: ✅ Working

### Next Steps
1. **Authenticate Vercel CLI** using `vercel login`
2. **Re-run deployment** once authenticated
3. All security issues are already resolved

---
**Summary**: Security vulnerabilities fixed ✅ | Vercel authentication needed ⚠️
