# AI-Native Architect Agent Report

## Mission & Results

**Objective**: Enterprise architectural review and production system design for Kasama AI  
**Outcome**: ‚úÖ 90-day implementation roadmap with enterprise-grade architecture recommendations

## Key Deliverables

### üó∫Ô∏è 90-Day Sprint Plan

**Phase 1 (Days 1-30)**: Backend foundation + state management + dev pipeline  
**Phase 2 (Days 31-60)**: Assessment engine + learning platform + AI integration  
**Phase 3 (Days 61-90)**: Advanced AI features + performance + security

### üè¢ Resource Planning

**Team**: 4.5 FTE (Full-Stack, Backend, AI/ML, UI/UX, QA/Security)  
**Budget**: $190K (3 months) | **Timeline**: 90 days to production MVP

### ‚öôÔ∏è Quality Framework

**Validation**: 8-step cycle with AI integration  
**Targets**: <2s load, 99.5% uptime, GDPR/CCPA ready, ‚â•90% unit test coverage

### üõ°Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

**Strategy**: Incremental AI rollout + B2B2C validation + refactoring cycles + cost monitoring

## Technical Recommendations

### **Architecture Decisions**

1. **State Management**: Zustand over Redux (simpler API, better TypeScript)
2. **AI Provider**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet primary, GPT-4 fallback
3. **Database Strategy**: Supabase with client-side encryption
4. **Deployment**: Vercel for frontend, Supabase Cloud for backend

### **Performance Targets**

- Page Load Time: <2 seconds
- API Response Time: <200ms
- User Retention: >70% week 1
- AI Insight Accuracy: >85%

### **Scalability Planning**

- Multi-tenant architecture for B2B2C expansion
- Microservices-ready Edge Functions
- CDN optimization for global reach
- Auto-scaling database and compute resources

## Implementation Priority Matrix

| Priority | Component              | Timeline   | Business Impact |
