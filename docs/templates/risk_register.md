## Risk Scoring Matrix

### Probability Scale

- **5 - Very High**: >80% chance of occurring
- **4 - High**: 60-80% chance of occurring
- **3 - Medium**: 40-60% chance of occurring
- **2 - Low**: 20-40% chance of occurring
- **1 - Very Low**: <20% chance of occurring

### Impact Scale

- **5 - Critical**: Project failure, >30% budget/schedule overrun
- **4 - Major**: Significant impact, 20-30% budget/schedule overrun
- **3 - Moderate**: Noticeable impact, 10-20% budget/schedule overrun
- **2 - Minor**: Small impact, 5-10% budget/schedule overrun
- **1 - Negligible**: Minimal impact, <5% budget/schedule overrun

### Risk Score Calculation

**Risk Score = Probability × Impact**

- **20-25**: Critical Risk (Red)
- **15-19**: High Risk (Orange)
- **10-14**: Medium Risk (Yellow)
- **5-9**: Low Risk (Green)
- **1-4**: Minimal Risk (Blue)
