## Notes & Clarifications

### Role Overlaps

- When multiple R's exist, designate a lead responsible party
- A's should escalate if R's cannot agree
- C's should respond within 24-48 hours

### Delegation Rules

- A's can delegate to R's but retain accountability
- R's cannot delegate without A's approval
- C's can delegate expertise provision with notification

### Review Schedule

- RACI reviewed monthly during active project
- Updates require PM and PO approval
- Team changes trigger immediate RACI review
